Step 1: Build Intuition

Imagine YouTube subscriptions.
You subscribe to a channel (you’re an observer).
The channel (the subject) uploads a new video.
You (and all subscribers) automatically get notified.

👉 Key point: The subject doesn’t care who the observers are — it just says, “Hey, I changed!” and notifies everyone.



Step 2: Structure of Observer

Subject (Publisher) → keeps a list of observers, provides attach(), detach(), and notify().
Observer → has an update() method.
Concrete Observers → actual subscribers who react when notified.
