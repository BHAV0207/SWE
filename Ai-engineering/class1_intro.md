Introduction ti Ai engineering 
what is ML engineering -> train models from scratch
AI engineering -> Production App -> powered by foundational models 
examples of fiundational models -> LLM'S . Diffusion models , Muiltimodality models 
Few Pillars 
->Integration of pre-Trained models 
-> Propt designe and operations 
-> Orchrestration of AI comp (LLLM , RAG , agents)
-> Evaluation and observalibility 
-> fine-tuning 
-> Production concern -> COST , latency , reliability , safety 

There are manny layers 
->Application layer 
-> Orchestration Layer
-> Observability layer 
-> Models layer 
-> Infrastructure layer
