Nice — let’s unpack Proxy slowly and clearly so it actually clicks. I’ll explain what it is, why it’s useful, walk the Image (virtual proxy) example step-by-step, list other proxy types with short examples, show pitfalls and implementation tips (thread-safety, caching, etc.), and finish with a tiny set of practice choices. One question at the end so we can keep the session interactive.

What is the Proxy pattern? (plain English)

A Proxy is a stand-in object that implements the same interface as some real object and controls access to that real object. The client talks to the proxy — not directly to the heavy/real object — and the proxy decides what to do (forward, block, cache, lazy-load, log, etc.).

Analogy: you call a hotel concierge (proxy) instead of contacting dozens of services yourself (real subsystems). The concierge decides what to call and when.

Core pieces (roles)

Subject — the interface used by client (e.g., Image with display()).

RealSubject — the real object that does the actual work and may be expensive.

Proxy — same interface, holds a reference to RealSubject, adds extra behavior (lazy init, access control, caching, logging).

Client — talks to Subject (could be proxy or real subject).

Simple UML-ish view:

Client -> (Subject) Proxy -> RealSubject

Why use Proxy? (common reasons)

Lazy initialization (Virtual Proxy): don’t build the heavy object until it’s needed.

Access control / Security: check permissions before forwarding.

Remote proxy: provide a local stub for a remote object (e.g., RMI).

Caching / Smart reference: store results so repeated calls are faster.

Logging / Monitoring / Throttling: track or limit calls.

Deep dive — Virtual proxy image example (step-by-step)

We’ll use the Image example you saw. I’ll annotate the call sequence.

Classes:

interface Image { void display(); }

class RealImage implements Image {
  private String filename;
  public RealImage(String filename) {
    this.filename = filename;
    loadFromDisk();          // expensive work
  }
  private void loadFromDisk() { System.out.println("Loading " + filename); }
  public void display() { System.out.println("Displaying " + filename); }
}

class ProxyImage implements Image {
  private String filename;
  private RealImage realImage; // initially null

  public ProxyImage(String filename) { this.filename = filename; }

  public void display() {
    if (realImage == null) {
      realImage = new RealImage(filename); // create only when needed
    }
    realImage.display();
  }
}


Call trace (explanation):

new ProxyImage("photo.png") → only the proxy object is created. realImage is null. No heavy work done.

proxy.display() is called: Proxy checks if (realImage == null) → true, so it constructs RealImage("photo.png"). That runs loadFromDisk() (expensive).

Proxy calls realImage.display() → shows the image.

If proxy.display() is called again, proxy sees realImage != null and does not load from disk again — it directly forwards to realImage.display().

Advantages shown: expensive loadFromDisk() invoked only when needed, and only once.
