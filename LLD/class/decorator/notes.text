1. The Intuition

Think of coffee at a caf√©:

You start with a simple coffee (base object).

Then you can decorate it with milk, sugar, whipped cream, caramel, etc.

Each add-on adds new behavior (cost, description) without changing the base class.

That‚Äôs what the Decorator pattern does:

Attach new functionality to an object dynamically.

Achieve this via composition, not inheritance.

2. Where/When to Use It

When you want to add features without exploding subclasses.

Example: Instead of CoffeeWithMilk, CoffeeWithSugar, CoffeeWithMilkAndSugar, ‚Ä¶

Use a decorator chain.

When behavior needs to be combined flexibly.

GUI frameworks, stream APIs, and middleware use it heavily.

3. Structure

Component: Interface (e.g., Coffee)

ConcreteComponent: Real object (e.g., SimpleCoffee)

Decorator: Abstract class implementing the same interface, holding a reference to the component.

ConcreteDecorators: Add actual features (e.g., MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator).



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUILDER AND DECORATOR 


üî® Builder Pattern

Goal: Help construct complex objects step by step.

When to use: When an object has many optional configurations.

How it works:

You use a builder object with methods like .addCheese() or .setGPU().

Finally call .build() to get the finished product.

Key idea: Focus is on object creation.

After build: Object is usually immutable.

‚úÖ Example:
Creating a Computer with optional GPU, RAM, storage, etc.

Computer gamingPC = new Computer.Builder("Intel i9", 32)
                       .storage(1000)
                       .gpu("RTX 4090")
                       .build();

üé® Decorator Pattern

Goal: Dynamically add responsibilities (behavior/attributes) to objects at runtime.

When to use: When you need to extend behavior flexibly without subclass explosion.

How it works:

You wrap the original object in one or more decorator classes.

Each decorator adds new functionality (+milk, +sugar, etc.).

Key idea: Focus is on object extension (wrapping), not creation.

After decoration: Object can be wrapped further ‚Üí open-ended flexibility.

‚úÖ Example:

Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);   // add milk
coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);  // add sugar

üîë Key Differences
Aspect	Builder üèóÔ∏è	Decorator üéÅ
Purpose	Construct complex objects step by step	Extend behavior of existing objects dynamically
Focus	Object creation	Object modification/wrapping
When used	At object build time	At object runtime
End result	A finished immutable object	An object that can keep getting new functionality
Example analogy	Ordering a custom-built computer	Adding toppings to your coffee

üëâ Simple way to remember:

Builder = how you make it

Decorator = how you dress it up
