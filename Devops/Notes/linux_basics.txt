linux is very lightwieght as compared to windiws and it gives you much more controll over your system as compared to the windows to the users
In windows you can just install next , next and wallah you are done downloading , this should that the userd does not have the full controll over what they are doing in the windows os , this is like 70 to 80 % controll 

in reality linux is not an OS , its a kernel in reality 
a Kernel is a software that connects the hardware and the os 
There are distributions that are made over these kernels example opensuse , popos , ubuntu etc...
