docker is a containerization platform whihc helps to package files and its dependencies 

container is the place where all the (files and its dependencies) ie images are stored , which can be used anywhere 

docker is not like virtual machine , unlike vm docker does is very lightweight , and the dependencies are taken care by docker , just use the right images whereas in vm you have to setup everything 
in vm you have its own os which takes a lot of space and load on machine , whereas docker use the machines os itself and build the image 
ony drawback of docker here is that yo dont get a desktop like vm , you get only the terminal here 

// COMMANDS 

docker pull imageName => To  pull any image from the docker we use the command 
docker images => to get the list of all the images in the syatem 
docker ps => give sthe list of all the running containers 
docker ps -a => all the list of current and past containers 
docker run => runs the image and makes a conatiner of it 
docker run -it => force run 
docker stop containerId => to stop the conatiner  
dokcer start =>  once you hav reuunde a container then , you should do docker start from the next time 

PORT MAPPING 
to connect the docker image to the local machine or to see the respones of it on the local machine we use port mapping 
we know that suppose we are running nginx on docker , but if we want to use it on are local we will have to port mapping

command =>  run -it -p 8080:80 nginx 
in the above command  we have mapped the local port to the docker internal port 


docker exec -it constaineId => this command helps run any command from loacal directly to the docker enviroment 
eg -> docker exec -it conatinerID ls 

docker inspect constainerId => gives the imfo about the conatainer 

// DOCKERFILE 
dockerfile is a set of instruction on how to build the docker image 
it is a file in the project
