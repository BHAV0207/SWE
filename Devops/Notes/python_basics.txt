python is a high level language 
it is a open-source comunity driven language 
it is dynamically typed language ->  the type checking is done at runtime and not at compile time , which menas that eg -> x =10 and then we write that x = "hello" it will not give any error at compile time , it will figure the type at the rutime 


python is a object oriented laguage , so it has datatypes and obects 
the datatypes are integer , string , float , boolean etc....
the objects are the collection of datatypes ->  lists , dictionary , Tuples/Set etc...

Lists ->  basically an array , in python a list can be of multiple datatypes , eg -> a = [1,2,3,4,"hey" ,5]
Tuples -> are immutable in nature unlike the list , eg -> a = (1,2,3,"hello", 6.8, 3)
sets -> are hashset of java -> {}
dictionary -> are hashmap of java -> {}


CONDITIONALS 
if , elif , else 
for loop -> for i in range(10)...etc

MODULES 
these are the packages that we can use to do several things , these provides us with functions and attributes that we can use 
we can also create our own packages 

FILE HANDLING 
one of the most important basic of file handeling is that whenever you are reading a file you must close it in the end to prevent memory leak 
r -> read only 
r+ -> read and write 
eg-> f = open('data.txt' , 'r')  // this is only in the read mode 


ERROR 
to deal with errors we can use , try and except blocks 
eg -> try: 
        print(a/b)
      except: 
        print("something went wrong")

COMPILER AND INTERPRITER
compiler is a program that converters the whole code into maching language at the compile time and checks for any mistake 
a interpreter is a program that does not take the whole like the compiler , rather it takes the code line by line and executes the code
