in microservices the request first goes to the DNS server ,
from there the request goes to the Load Balacer where there are two types of request that is path based or instance based , ie path based is that the load balancer gets the path to which microservices this reuest has to be send and one servcie can have many instances , so which instance to be called is the instance based load balancing 
in a microservices architecture there are many services and each service has many instances , so between all the services there should be load balancers so that to which instance the request shoul be send etc 
between the srevices there are two types of communication that is sync and async , sync communication is done by api and async is done by  extetnal tools like kafka 
in async communication there is the possibility of eventual consistency , whihc in some cases is unacceptable where we need immediate responses etc....
in the a async communication there are two types that are , pub sub and queue based , in the pub sub the subscriber is notified when there is something publishes by the publisher
in async communiation we dont need load balancer
